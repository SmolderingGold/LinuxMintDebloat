# Linux Mint Debloat Script


**This will remove:**
- Office suite (LibreOffice)
- Default email client (Thunderbird)
- Media players (VLC, Rhythmbox)
- BitTorrent (Transmission)
- Chat apps (Hexchat, Pidgin)
- Mint apps (Hypnotix, Drawing, Pix, Sticky, Xreader, Simple-Scan, Webapp Manager, Warpinator)
- Entire printer subsystem (CUPS, HPLIP)
- Firefox & all locales

This will also disable bluetooth but leave it installed.

It's good idea to install your browser of choice before this and assign as the default browser.

Celluloid and Image viewer remain as the default media players.

This script saves like 1.5GB - 2GB of space. You're welcome :D
